## Current Blockers

### High Priority
- **Unity 6.2 Editor** - Manual installation required for compilation testing and scene creation
- **Functional npm scripts** - Current test/build scripts are echo stubs, need actual implementations
- **Test framework** - No Jest/Mocha installed yet (package.json exists but no test dependencies)

### Medium Priority
- **MCP server environment variables** - Some servers need proper .env configuration (GitHub token, API keys)
- **Unity Gaming Services credentials** - Need to configure Economy, Authentication, Lobby services in Unity Dashboard
- **.gitignore missing** - Need proper Unity + Node.js exclusions (Library/, Temp/, node_modules/, etc.)

### Low Priority
- **Container registry permissions** - GitHub secrets need configuration for GHCR push (workflow is ready)
- **Input System configuration** - Need to create Input Actions asset for New Input System
- **Audio Mixer creation** - Need to create mixer asset with Master/Music/SFX/Voice groups
