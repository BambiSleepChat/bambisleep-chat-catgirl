## 🎯 Recommended First Debugging Session

### Scenario: Debug CatgirlController Network Spawning

**Goal:** Understand NetworkBehaviour lifecycle and verify multiplayer setup

**Breakpoints to set:**

1. Line 76 - `Start()` method
2. Line 112 - `OnNetworkSpawn()` method
3. Line 150 - `Update()` first line
4. Line 210 - `UpdatePositionServerRpc()` method

**Watch expressions to add:**

```
IsOwner
OwnerClientId
NetworkObject.IsSpawned
NetworkManager.Singleton.IsServer
currentSpeed
networkPosition.Value
```

**Steps:**

```
1. Open CatgirlController.cs in VS Code
2. Set breakpoints on lines 76, 112, 150, 210 (press F9)
3. Add watch expressions (Debug panel → Watch section)
4. Press F5 → "Attach to Unity Editor and Play"
5. Unity enters Play mode → Breakpoint hits on line 76 (Start)
6. Press F10 to step through initialization
7. Observe watch expressions update
8. Press F5 to continue → Breakpoint hits on line 112 (OnNetworkSpawn)
9. Step through network initialization
10. Press F5 → Breakpoint hits repeatedly on line 150 (Update loop)
11. Observe currentSpeed changes
12. Move character → Breakpoint hits on line 210 (ServerRpc)
13. Inspect network state in Watch panel
```

**Expected behavior:**

- Start() executes once at GameObject creation
- OnNetworkSpawn() executes once after NetworkObject spawns
- Update() executes every frame (~60 times/second)
- UpdatePositionServerRpc() executes when position changes

**Learning outcomes:**

- Unity MonoBehaviour lifecycle order
- NetworkBehaviour spawn sequence
- RPC invocation flow
- Network ownership model

## 💎 Pro Debugging Tips

### Tip 1: Use Conditional Breakpoints for Rare Bugs

```csharp
// Right-click breakpoint → Edit Breakpoint → Condition:
currentSpeed > 5.0f  // Only break when moving fast
item.itemId == "divine_cow_crown_001"  // Only break for cow crown
OwnerClientId == 2  // Only break for specific client
```

### Tip 2: Logpoints for Non-Intrusive Logging

```csharp
// Right-click line → Add Logpoint → Message:
Speed: {currentSpeed}, Grounded: {isGrounded}
// Logs to Debug Console without pausing execution
```

### Tip 3: Multi-Window Debugging

```
1. Open 2 VS Code windows (Ctrl+Shift+N)
2. Window 1: Attach to Unity Editor (host)
3. Window 2: Attach to standalone build (client)
4. Debug multiplayer interactions simultaneously!
```

### Tip 4: Debug Console Evaluation

```
While paused at breakpoint, type in Debug Console:
> currentSpeed * 2
> Debug.Log(transform.position)
> GameObject.Find("CatGirl").name
```

### Tip 5: Exception Breakpoints

```
Debug panel → Breakpoints section → Check:
✓ All Exceptions
Breaks immediately when exception thrown (even if caught)
```

## 🐛 Common Issues Quick Reference

| Issue | Quick Fix |
|-------|-----------|
| "No Unity process found" | Ensure Unity in Play mode, restart both Unity & VS Code |
| Breakpoints not hitting | Check script attached to GameObject, no compile errors |
| UGS auth fails | Verify await order: Init → Auth → Economy |
| RPC not working | Check NetworkObject.IsSpawned, ownership requirements |
| Animator not updating | Verify hash IDs match parameter names exactly |
| UI not refreshing | Check InventorySystem reference assigned, events subscribed |

## 🌸 BambiSleep™ Debug Philosophy

> "Debug like a catgirl: curious, playful, and persistent!" 🐱

**Core principles:**

1. **Set breakpoints liberally** - More is better when learning
2. **Watch expressions tell the story** - Observe state changes
3. **Logpoints for production** - Non-intrusive monitoring
4. **Conditional breakpoints for edge cases** - Catch rare bugs
5. **Multi-window for multiplayer** - See both perspectives
6. **Debug Console for live experimentation** - Test hypotheses

**Emoji debugging conventions:**

- 🦋 NetworkBehaviour events (transformations)
- 💎 High-value features (premium systems)
- 🐄 Secret features (cow powers)
- 🔥 Performance-critical paths (hot code)
- ✨ UI polish (visual effects)
